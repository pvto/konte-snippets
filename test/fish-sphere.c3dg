/*
 =======
  Konte meshes are lattices of quadrilaterals
  Reserved keywords are:
    mesh (determines the current mesh: floating point, rounded to 1000th)
    row  (determines the current row in a mesh to pile pieces to)
    MESH (call to insert a piece into a lattice)

  There must be at least two rows and two columns,
    otherwise a mesh won't draw.

  There is no integrity check on the number of columns in
    different rows. If you are not careful, some meshes may
    see to be distorted!
